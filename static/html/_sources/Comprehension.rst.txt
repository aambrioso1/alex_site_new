 """This is a lesson in comprehension.   Comprehension is a nice way to build lists, sets, and dictionaries
 
 In Python you can build a list in three differnt ways:
 (1) Using a for loop.
 (2) Using a map function.
 (3) Using comprehension.

 You can find a nice tutorial on comprehension here:
 https://realpython.com/list-comprehension-python/
 The tutorial include a discussion on when to use 
 comprehension.

 Here are the forms of comprehension in Python suggested by the article:

 (3) new_list = [expression for member in iterable]
 (4) new_list = [expression for member in iterable (if conditional)]
 (5) new_list = [expression (if conditional) for member in iterable]
 (6) At the end, I generate a set and a dictionary using comprehension.

 # Every list comprehension has three parts:  (1) a member, (2) an expression, and (3) an iterable.
 # A conditional is optional and can be used to control membership.
 """
 # We will generate lists using this string.
 alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'

 # (1) Construct a list using a loop.
 list1 = []
 for letter in alphabet:
 list1.append(letter)
 
 # (2) Construct using the map function. 
 list2 = list(map(lambda i: i, alphabet))
 print('map =', list2)

 # (3) Construct a list using comprehension.
 list3 = [letter for letter in alphabet]
  
 print('list1 = ', list1)
 print('list2 = ', list2)
 print('list3 = ', list3)
 
 # Examples using conditionals along with comprehension.
 # (4) new_list = [expression for member in iterable (if conditional)]
 vowels1 = {i for i in alphabet if i in 'aeiou'}
 print('The vowels are', vowels1)
 
 
 # (4) new_list = [expression for member in iterable (if conditional)]
 
 # Here we generate a set to show that comprehension can be used to generate sets.
 consonants =  {i for i in alphabet if i not in 'aeiou'}
 print('The consonants are', consonants)
 
 # (5) new_list = [expression (if conditional) for member in iterable]
 delete_vowels = [letter if letter not in 'aeiou' else '*' for letter in alphabet]
 print('Letters with vowels marked', delete_vowels)
 
 # vowels2 = [i (if i in 'aeiou') for i in alphabet]
 # print('The vowels are', vowels2)
 
 # (6) Comprehension can also be used to generate a dictionary.  
 # Create a dictionary using comprehension.
 dict1 = {i: alphabet[i] for i in range(26)}
 print(f'The last letter of the alphabet is {dict1[25]}.')
