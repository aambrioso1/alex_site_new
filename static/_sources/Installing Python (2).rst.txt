Introduction
============

We live in a unique time in that the ability to program is accessible to everyone.  Open source programming languages, and their associated libraries and communities, can enhance work in any occupation or field of study by giving the user more power, through algorithms, over information and technology that is every present in today's society.   The Python programming language is easy to learn and powerful.   It has a large open-source community that provides support for work in every academic discipline.    Researchers in diverse fields from natural language processing to oceanography are using Python and its libraries to support their work.   This course is intended to teach the teacher to leverage the power of the algorithm, through the Python programming language, to enhance her own teaching.
