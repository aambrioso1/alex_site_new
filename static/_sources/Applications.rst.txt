Problem
-------
Suppose you throw random darts at a unit square in the first quadrant:   0 <= x <= 1  and 0 <= y <= 1.   What is the probability that a dart will land in this section: 0 <= x <= 0.25 and 0 <= y <= 0.25?  Now compute the probability that the dart will land inside the unit circle x^2 + y^2 â‰¤ 1 still keeping both x and y between 0 and 1?   How can we use this probability?
