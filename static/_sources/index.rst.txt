Introduction
------------

We live in a unique time in that the ability to program is accessible to everyone through open source resources.  Open source programming languages, and their associated libraries and communities, can enhance work in any occupation or field of study.  They give the user more power, through algorithms, over the information and technology that is every present in today's society.   

The Python programming language is open source, easy to learn, and powerful.   It has a large community that provides support for work in every academic discipline.    Researchers in diverse fields from natural language processing to oceanography are using Python and its libraries to support their work.   This book is intended to teach the teacher to leverage the power of the algorithm, through the Python, to enhance her own teaching.
