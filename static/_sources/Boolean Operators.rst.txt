Boolean Operators
=================

There are three Boolean operators in Python:

- `and`
- `or`
- `not`

Here we illustrate that each operator works as you would expect when the arguments are one of the two Boolean types, `True` or `False`.

The `and` operator:

.. code ::
>>> T = True
>>> F = False
>>> F and F
False
>>> F and T
False
>>> T and F
False
>>> T and T
True

The `or` operator:

.. code ::
>>> F or F
False
>>> F or T
True
>>> T or F
True
>>> T or T
True

The `not` operator:

.. code ::
>>> not F
True
>>> not T
False

As we shall see in the next section, these operators are used to control the flow of a program.
